This is process, a regression testing program for WorldForge servers.
The program has a builtin standard regression test sequence, plus a
scripting interface using python which allows custom tests to be run.
Note process is a 'black-box' test system; it only knows about
the formal specifications, nothing about the server implementations.
Thus, it should be a valid test for any server, implemented in
any langauge, on any platform. Isn't that cool?

Process now uses CppUnit, so it can produce results in any format
supported, including an XML one.
