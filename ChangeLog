	  doesn't appear to work correctly yet.

2005-02-09  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* loadtool/* : add initial load-testing harness, which sort of works,
	  but is currently very limited in scope, and buggy.
	  
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: build changes for compiling the load tool.

2004-11-20  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	  changes from James Turner to do some more thorough checking.

	* src/testIG.cpp: Fix look tests so that arguments of look
	  ops contain entity with ID, not just the ID itself, and
	  fix the expected LOC to be the ID of the parent, not the
	  parent's LOC.

2003-11-03 James Turner <james@worldforge.org>

	* Add more IG look tests - at the character, i.e a self look,
	  and at two random children of the world and character. Also
	  validate the LOC attribute of the recived entities.

2003-10-30  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/testLogin.h, src/testLogin.cpp, src/process.cpp:
	  Move login code into its own file.

	* src/testCharacter.h: Fix guard names.

	* src/tests.h, src/tests.cpp: Change testLogout() API as we don't

	  src/testCharacter.h: Move character creation related tests into
	  new file.

2003-10-30  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/testOOG.h, src/testOOG.cpp: Re-purpose files to contain
	  OOG Look and Talk test code copied from main().

	  of the tests in preparation for making them into functions as well.

2003-10-29  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Do not require the entity returned by intial IG
	  look to have a name.

2003-10-29  James Turner  <james@worldforge.org>

	* Add ProjectBuilder project, requires uncommitted Atlas-C++ 0.6
	  framework, skstream 0.3 framework from CVS, and python22 from
	  Fink.
	* Add a createChar method to ClientConnection, and change the
	  character tests to use it. As part of this, add a new tag
	  value to Connection, 'character', containing the entity ID,
	  and a new accessor.
	* Add an in-game LOOK test; currently this just tests an
	  anonymous look, but i'll be extending it to do a self look and
	  a few other things shortly.

2003-10-29  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.h: Remove old code, clean up some comments,
	  get rid of redundant includes and update copyright date.

	* src/atlasUtils.cpp, src/atlasUtils.h, src/pythonInterface.h,
	  src/testOOG.h, src/validator.h: Add copyright header, and
	  clean up includes.

	* src/gobshite.cpp, src/process.cpp: Implement cleaner code

2003-10-28  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Eliminate duplicating of Info ops,
	  and update usage of Atlas::Objects casts.

	* src/gobshite.cpp: Add code to load atlas.xml before running, as
	  is required.

2003-08-22  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Add some help documenting options.
	  Add new options to allow running standalone scripted
	  tests, or scripted tests that extend the current set.

	* src/pythonInterface.cpp, src/pythonInterface.h: Extend python
	  interface to allow a number of existing connections to be passed to
	  the script on startup. Default is that none are passed.

	* process.py: Add debug code to verify that a tuple of connections
	  are passed to the script.

2003-08-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* process.py: Remove debugging output.

2003-08-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/pythonInterface.h, src/pythonInterface.cpp:
	  Update python API code to Atlas-C++ 0.6

	* src/process.cpp: Re-add interface to python code, and start
	  work on allowing scripts to extend rather than replace existing
	  tests.

2003-08-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Switch to skstream-0.3, which is effectively a null change.

2003-08-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Clean up help for python prefix option, add check
	  for python 2.3 and use latest pthread check.

2003-08-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Port whole codebase to Atlas-C++ 0.6 API.

2003-06-27  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Clean up some of the output messages, so
	  they are easier to understand.

	* src/gobshite.cpp: Handle usage errors better.

	* src/process.cpp: Clarify an output message.

2003-06-23  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Clean up Makefile.am so dist and distcheck work.

2003-04-23 James Turner <james@worldforge.org>

	* Changed how the python lib check works, to avoid autoconf
	  caching issues.

2003-04-22  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Adapt python check so it works on BSD systems
	  without libutil.

2003-04-22 James Turner <james@worldforge.org>

	* Fix detection of Account ID by ClientConnection; use
	  the serialno of the activation op (either LOGIN or CREATE)
	  to detect which INFO response contains the account object.
	  This fixes compliance issues with Indri and Stage (which set
	  an ID attribute on the server object).
	* Added some tests to ensure the every account gets a valid ID,
	  and that other INFO ops do not cause the account ID to be set.
	* Handle servers the do not use 'lobby' as the root OOG room ID.
	  This required catching the results of the anonymous OOG LOOK and
	  extracting the ID from it.
	* Factored the code to compare arecived operation against an Atlas
	  template into a separate method on ClientConnection (previously in
	  ::waitFor). This allows code to use ClientConnection::recv() but
	  still validate the op.
	* Changed the OOG talk tests to use a custom template for validating
	  the SOUND responses. Using an Atlas::Objects instance converted to
	  a Message::Object is problematic becuase it demands every single
	  atribute defined by Objects::RootOperation to be present, including
	  a whole slew of optional ones (such as seconds and future seconds) 

2003-01-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Convert to pkgconfig.

2003-01-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/ClientConnection.h:
	  Store and make available the account id logged in on the current
	  connection.

	* src/process.cpp: Use account id rather than username when setting
	  FROM and TO on ops.

2002-12-01  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Change test character type to settler, as some
	  servers will not create a farmer.

2002-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Clean up configure script.

	* src/pythonInterface.cpp: Re-organise headers, and use ISO C++
	  header names.

2002-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/ClientConnection.h: Pass through
	  serialno when logging in, or creating account. Report refno of
	  incoming ops, and refno expected when waiting.

	* src/process.cpp: Add refno checks to all tests for which it is
	  apropriate.

2002-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/ClientConnection.h, src/process.cpp:
	  Re-structure core test code so it is more resiliant to things
	  that don't matter, and has the capability to check for refno.

2002-08-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/gobshite.cpp: Fix for ISO C++.

2002-08-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/gobshite.cpp: Added a new test client, that talks and talks,
	  but just won't listen.

2002-07-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/process.cpp, src/testOOG.cpp,
	  src/process.h, src/process_debug.h: Rename process.h to
	  process_debug.h to avoid header clash on windows.

2002-07-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/process.cpp, src/pythonInterface.cpp,
	  src/testOOG.cpp: ISO C++ compliance fixes.

2002-07-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Rationalise python checks.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Switch to username based login.

	* src/ClientConnection.h: Fix bug referencing a temporary.

	* src/atlasUtils.h, src/process.cpp, src/testOOG.cpp,
	  src/testOOG.h, src/validator.cpp, src/validator.h:
	  Make sure all the files have newlines on the end.

2002-06-26  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.h, src/ClientConnection.cpp:
	  Switch to new skstream header location.

	* src/atlasUtils.cpp: Fix config.h typo.

Sunday, May 12, James Turner

	* Updated the validator to check values as well as types
	  (not perfect, but better)
	* Added a getLastSerialno getter to ClientConnection to
	  work with recv()
	* Added an IG transition 'take' test (via LOOK) to
	  testOOG.
	* Factored out the account look logic into a helper
	  in testOOG.
	* Added tags support (map of key/value pairs) to
	  ClientConnection, and a helper function to retrive a
	  connection matching a given set of keys and values. This
	  is to allow the tests to be reasonably independant of
	  the set of client connections being maintained.

Saturday, May 11, James Turner

	* added acinclude.m4
	* Now require CppUnit to compile certain tests (not linked in yet,
	  but soon). The long term goal is to be able to integrate process
	  into a WorldForge-wide automated test system based on the CppUnit
	  and JUnit XML output.
	* Moved the validator logic out into a seperate file
	* Added some new behaviour to ClientConnection, to handle
	  'unexpected' (but correct) operations better. The other
	  upshot is that process will be much stricter about
	  refno / serialno setting for tests that use the new logic.
	* Moved one OOG test into a seperate file, converted it to
	  use CppUnit, the new ClientConnecton methods and the
	  seperate validator.
	* Updated TODO so I don't forget to test various things
	 
	All of the above is compiled but not actually called, till I
	decide how to integrate the ClientConnections. Should be done
	tomorrow, then I'll move over more tests and start adding new
	ones.

Monday, May 6, James Turner

	* add waitForError and waitForGet to client connection.
	  Why? Well waitFor makes it very hard to expect an ERROR op,
	  where the argument operarion is ARGS[1], not ARGS[0].
	  waitForGet allows you to retrieve the recived op, for all
	  kinds of thrilling fun.
	* Added testCharacterLook, which tests OOG inspection of
	  characters (and also that the server's account object
	  correctly lists created characters)

2002-02-20  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Logout tests added by James.

	* src/ClientConnection.h, src/ClientConnection.cpp: Add flag
	  so tests can be run which expect an error.

	* src/process.cpp: Fix _bad_type_ query so an error is expected
	  correctly, with arguments in the right form.

Saturday, January 26 2002, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* configure.in checks for skstream2 using the AM_PATH_SKSTREAM
	  macro
	* Updated ClientConnection.cpp to use skstream2, and also to
	  take full advanatge of the skstream setup code to handle
	  all the socket stuff
	* Remove client_fd from ClientConnection, and change all
	  access to use getSocket() on the socket_stream.

2002-01-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Switch type queries to use map arguments as they
	  should rather than string arguments.

2002-01-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* C++ compliance fixes for gcc 3.

Wednesday, December 19 2001, James Turner

	* Three simple tests of type-queries. Attempts to
	  retrieve the root object, the definition for 'game_entity',
	  and one invalid type ('__bad__type__').

2001-11-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Tidied up formatting of private chat tests,
	  and added character creation tests.

Wednesday, October 17 2001, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* basic tests for private chat functionality

2001-10-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Added TO to all OOG chat related ops, and
	  added a test which generates a warning on servers which don't
	  work without TO.

Sunday, October 14 2001, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* use a AM_PATH_SIGC in configure.in, for those of us with sigc++ in
	  weird places. 
	  
2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Modified tests so the "loc" attribute is used
	  in OOG ops. Added tests to ensure that appearance and disappearance
	  ops are created by logging in and out.

2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Adapted waitFor so it is tolerant
	  of unexpected ops.

2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.h: Added check if connection is open, so
	  tests can continue even if not all connections worked.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Implemented non-fatal warning if
	  numerical attributes are of the wrong numberical type.

	* src/process.cpp: Added tests for lobby chat.

2001-10-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Fixed login and create to send atlas
	  compliant acount objects with objtype and parents.

	* src/process.cpp: Added flag for repeatable regression tests.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/ClientConnection.h: Implemented
	  timeout when waiting for operations to arrive.

2001-09-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/pythonInterface.h, src/pythonInterface.cpp: Made python
	  interface take an argument, so that script to be run
	  can be specified.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Removed debugging output, and make
	  it clearer.

	* src/process.cpp: Implemented processing of options, including
	  verbose option. Pass name of script through to python code.
	  Re-add C++ standard test which is run if no script is given,
	  now with full verbose output available, or silent success
	  if required.
