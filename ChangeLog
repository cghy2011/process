2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Adapted waitFor so it is tolerant
	  of unexpected ops.

2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.h: Added check if connection is open, so
	  tests can continue even if not all connections worked.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Implemented non-fatal warning if
	  numerical attributes are of the wrong numberical type.

	* src/process.cpp: Added tests for lobby chat.

	* src/process.cpp: Added flag for repeatable regression tests.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/ClientConnection.h: Implemented
	  timeout when waiting for operations to arrive.

2001-09-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/pythonInterface.h, src/pythonInterface.cpp: Made python
	  interface take an argument, so that script to be run
	  can be specified.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Removed debugging output, and make
	  it clearer.

	* src/process.cpp: Implemented processing of options, including
	  verbose option. Pass name of script through to python code.
	  Re-add C++ standard test which is run if no script is given,
	  now with full verbose output available, or silent success
	  if required.
