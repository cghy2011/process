	* add waitForError and waitForGet to client connection.
	  Why? Well waitFor makes it very hard to expect an ERROR op,
	  where the argument operarion is ARGS[1], not ARGS[0].
	  waitForGet allows you to retrieve the recived op, for all
	  kinds of thrilling fun.
	* Added testCharacterLook, which tests OOG inspection of
	  characters (and also that the server's account object
	  correctly lists created characters)

	* src/process.cpp: Logout tests added by James.

	* src/ClientConnection.h, src/ClientConnection.cpp: Add flag
	  so tests can be run which expect an error.

	* src/process.cpp: Fix _bad_type_ query so an error is expected
	  correctly, with arguments in the right form.

Saturday, January 26 2002, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* configure.in checks for skstream2 using the AM_PATH_SKSTREAM
	  macro
	* Updated ClientConnection.cpp to use skstream2, and also to
	  take full advanatge of the skstream setup code to handle
	  all the socket stuff
	* Remove client_fd from ClientConnection, and change all
	  access to use getSocket() on the socket_stream.

	* src/process.cpp: Switch type queries to use map arguments as they
	  should rather than string arguments.

	* Three simple tests of type-queries. Attempts to
	  retrieve the root object, the definition for 'game_entity',
	  and one invalid type ('__bad__type__').

	* src/process.cpp: Tidied up formatting of private chat tests,
	  and added character creation tests.

	* basic tests for private chat functionality

2001-10-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Added TO to all OOG chat related ops, and
	  added a test which generates a warning on servers which don't
	  work without TO.

	* use a AM_PATH_SIGC in configure.in, for those of us with sigc++ in
	  weird places. 
	  
2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Modified tests so the "loc" attribute is used
	  in OOG ops. Added tests to ensure that appearance and disappearance
	  ops are created by logging in and out.

2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Adapted waitFor so it is tolerant
	  of unexpected ops.

2001-10-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.h: Added check if connection is open, so
	  tests can continue even if not all connections worked.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Implemented non-fatal warning if
	  numerical attributes are of the wrong numberical type.

	* src/process.cpp: Added tests for lobby chat.

2001-10-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Fixed login and create to send atlas
	  compliant acount objects with objtype and parents.

2001-09-25  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/process.cpp: Added flag for repeatable regression tests.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp, src/ClientConnection.h: Implemented
	  timeout when waiting for operations to arrive.

2001-09-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* src/pythonInterface.h, src/pythonInterface.cpp: Made python
	  interface take an argument, so that script to be run
	  can be specified.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Removed debugging output, and make
	  it clearer.

	* src/process.cpp: Implemented processing of options, including
	  verbose option. Pass name of script through to python code.
	  Re-add C++ standard test which is run if no script is given,
	  now with full verbose output available, or silent success
	  if required.
