	* src/pythonInterface.h, src/pythonInterface.cpp: Made python
	  interface take an argument, so that script to be run
	  can be specified.

	* src/ClientConnection.cpp: Removed debugging output, and make
	  it clearer.

	* src/process.cpp: Implemented processing of options, including
	  verbose option. Pass name of script through to python code.
	  Re-add C++ standard test which is run if no script is given,
	  now with full verbose output available, or silent success
	  if required.
